# state_quarter_game

How well do you know the state quarters? Find out with this GUI game! 

From 1999 to 2008, the United States Mint distributed special quarters for each state. Since I collected state quarters as a kid, I wondered how good I would be at identifying the state that each quarter represents.

The game cycles randomly through all 50 quarters and gives the user 5 chances to guess the corresponding state. The state names have been photoshopped off of all quarters. The textbox for the user to make their guesses will light up green for the correct answer and will turn red for incorrect guesses. The textbox accepts two letter state acronyms or full state names and is not case sensitive.

After two incorrect guesses, a hint is provided about the states geographic location. After three incorrect guesses, another hint is given. After five incorrect guesses, the guessing textbox becomes disabled and the correct answer is displayed. Hit the “Next” button to display the next state quarter.

The user gets 100 points for getting the state correct on the first try, 75 for the second try, 50 for the third try, 25 for the fourth try, and 5 for the fifth try. 



## Here is an example screenshot of the game:

After hitting start, the game begins and the first state quarter appears. Here, the user had guessed Maine which was incorrect so the textbox turned red. Additionally, Maine was added to the top of the screen as a previously guessed answer.

Here the user guessed Vermont, which was also incorrect, so the textbox turned red and Vermont was added to the previously guessed items. Since this was the second incorrect guess, it triggered the hint function which tells the user the general reigon of the state.

The user made another incorrect guess and was prompted with another hint, and then guessed Oklahoma which was correct. The textbox turned greem as an indication of the correctness.
